# ComfyUI Metadata Extractor

A **work-in-progress (WIP)** Tkinter-based tool for extracting ComfyUI-style metadata from PNG images. It currently works best when your image has a **single prompt** in the workflow. Future updates will make it more versatile for more complex metadata.

## Installation & Usage

### Option 1: Download the `Metadata Extractor.exe`
- No Python required — just run the `.exe`.
<br>

### Option 2: Run the Python Code
1. **Install Python** (with Tkinter). On most systems, Python includes Tkinter by default, but ensure you select “tcl/tk and IDLE” during installation if needed.
2. **Clone or download** this repository.
3. **Install dependencies** (the code primarily uses standard libraries plus Pillow).
4. **Run** `Metadata_Extractor.py`.

That’s it! Feedback and contributions are welcome — as mentioned, this is still a work in progress, and more robust multi-prompt handling is coming soon.
